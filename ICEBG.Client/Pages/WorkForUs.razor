                        Dioptra will soon build a team to expand its SaaS real estate analytics product offering. We need
                        talented technologists and real estate/banking analysts. We are far more interested in the diverse skills that you can bring
                        rather than focusing on specific prior experience. We like to mentor great candidates; it's all about
                        your potential. Please get in touch if you want to know more.

                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        Real estate investment is complex business with a blizzard of detailed cashflow that drives returns at all levels of the capital
                        structure. Our job is to manage this data, tracking detailed cashflow and producing penny-accurate capital structure and waterfall
                        analysis. Additionally, we forecast future performance arising from micro and macro economic factors.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        On the micro front, Dioptra tracks variance between budgets and actually observed cashflow, which has a lot to say about future potential
                        performance. From a macro economic perspective interest rates drive contractual debt interest due, and liquid traded yield curves spell out
                        a central forecast of likely asset and loan performance. Interest rate options markets determine expected variance to this central forecast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        As an analyst at Dioptra, your role will be to disentangle this broad dataset by applying both traditional real estate cashflow analysis
                        and stochastic mathematics used in derivatives trading. This already gives our clients resolution on portfolio risks and opportunities
                        far beyond other real estate financial analytics systems' capability.

                        We will hire <strong>programmers</strong>, <strong>data engineers</strong> and <strong>designers</strong> with a range of skills. Our stack is
                        centered around ASP.NET and is hosted on Azure. We seek a broad range of skills among our technologists so you don't necessarily need previous
                        experience in these two areas.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        We care about engineering excellence. Dioptra performs rich data analysis in a very performant manner: most of a user's experience involves latency
                        under 50ms. Dioptra feels as performant as a lightweight spreadsheet despite handling significant compute load. If you are a programmer you will
                        use all your skills to enhance this UX excellence despite increasing computing requirement and scale.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        As a data engineer you will straddle the technology and analysis teams. Our innaugural product's data model already has almost 200 entities and this will grow substantially. To imagine the
                        scale of the dataset, consider two things that Dioptra will model. First complex construction projects. Stand in front of a large building and start to look at all the materials
                        used in its construction, from concrete, throught wood, to pipework, electrical conduits and even nuts and bolts. You will model the lot. Second for real estate occupied by tenants,
                        think about the cashflow associated with a large retail mall: rent, utility costs, parking revenues, etc. Again this is a huge dataset.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        Dioptra is committed to great design and you can see screen shots of our first product Vectis on the main page. We are one of the co-sponsors of
                        <a href="https://material-blazor.com" target="_blank">Material.Blazor</a>, an open source library integrating Google's Material Design web implementation with ASP.NET Blazor.
                        This was featured by Microsoft in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLDvQ-bOw8" target="_blank">ASP.NET Community Standup</a> video stream in late 2020.
                        As a designer you will deliver best in class desgin to make Dioptra's UX as intuitive and fluid as possible.
